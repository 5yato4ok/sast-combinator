    "description": "Collection of C++ components that power the commercial Nx Video Management System (VMS). Includes the source code for the cross-platform Desktop Client and shared libraries. The project heavily depends on the Qt 6.9.* framework and uses modern C++23+ features. The Desktop Client can connect to either Nx Cloud (hosted on AWS) or directly to a VMS Media Server to retrieve information about cameras, users, events, and more."
